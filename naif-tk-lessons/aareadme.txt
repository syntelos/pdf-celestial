   Each lesson is provided as a ".tar" package for Unix platforms
   and as a ".zip" package for Windows platforms. 

   Each package includes a single directory containing pairs of text
   ("*.txt") and HTML ("*.html") documents providing the lesson for
   FORTRAN ("*_f.*"), C ("*_c.*"), IDL ("*_idl.*"), and MATLAB ("*_m.*")
   programming language. Each package also includes the supporting 
   SPICE kernels ("kernels" subdirectory) for lessons needing them, and 
   diagrams in MS PowerPoint and PDF format ("diagram" subdirectory). 
   One lesson has some auxiliary source code ("src" subdirectory).

   The packages--either eight tar files or eight zip files--should be 
   ftp'd to your machine in binary FTP mode. This is usually accomlished
   in your browser window by simply clicking on the individual file 
   names, one at a time.

   The lessons are provided in both plain text and in HTML. The plain 
   text versions may be used anywhere on your computer. But NAIF suggests 
   you use the HTML versions as these include many convenient hyperlinks 
   to Toolkit documentation and module headers. In order to have these
   hyperlinks work you MUST create a "lessons" directory under the 
   "doc/html" directory of your Toolkit tree and copy each html lesson 
   document to that subdirectory. Then load the lesson file name into 
   your web browser.
