<title>Representation of World Coordinate Systems (WCS) in FITS</title>
<h1>Representation of World Coordinate Systems in FITS</h1>

<H2> Current status of the negotiations</H2>

<P> <A HREF="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~egreisen">Eric Greisen</a> (NRAO)
and <A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/">Mark
Calabretta</A> (ATNF) have been working on a proposed mechanism to
transfer coordinate information in detail in FITS headers and tables.
The work on the current papers was begun in 1992, following the ADASS
meeting in Boston.  It has a considerable history some of which is
described in the following section.  The state of these documents was
discussed in the latest ADASS meeting, held in November 1998 at the
University of Illinois and some tentative agreements were reached.  As
a result, Mark and I have reworked the documents, turning them into
three separate papers.  We have already received considerable
feedback, particularly on the subject of units, which has led to
significant improvements in the papers.</P>


<P> There will now be four papers: I on general matters, II on ideal
celestial coordinates, III on ideal spectral coordinates, and IV on
distortion corrections used to convert real instruments into these
ideal coordinates.  Draft documents for Papers I, II, and III are
presently available.  The 2001 ADASS directed us to make certain
changes to the papers which we have done.  These are color coded in
green.  The NOAO (IRAF) group reviewed those documents and further
changes/corrections made (after 10/18) partly as a result of their
comments are colored in blue.  Recent changes are in red and those
made after December 12, 2001 are in purple..  All changes since the
last release of Paper II (11/2000) are in red.  Note that the
appendices have been moved into the main text.  Frank Valdes has added
a practical projection  suited to optical instruments to Paper III.

We believe that these are nearing readiness for submission to,
consideration by, and (one hopes) prompt voting by the regional FITS
committees.  However, there are one or two serious  matters still
under advisement affecting all 3 papers before they can be submitted
to these committees.  Paper IV is being worked on as well, but it is
complex and will take time.
</P>

<P> Paper I describes a very general method for specifying
coordinates.  A pixel-to-coordinate matrix PCj_i will replace  CROTAj,
units will be described with a new keyword CUNITj, and secondary sets
of coordinate descriptions may be specified.  A complete system of
unit specification is described and is expected to supplement the IAU
standard system of units.  Methods for describing the coordinates of
matrices in binary tables are also described.</P>

<P> Paper II applies the general rules of Paper I to the specific
problem of specifying celestial coordinates in a two-dimensional
projection of the sky.  The coordinate system is specified with the
new keyword RADESYS and a large number of "projections" are defined.
Oblique projections are described and illustrated.  Several examples
of header interpretation and construction are given including one that
specifies coordinates on a planetary body rather than the celestial
sphere.  The application to binary tables is described.</P>

<P> Paper III applies the general rules and practices developed in the
first two papers to spectral coordinates, namely frequency, wavelength,
velocity, and the radio and optical conventional "velocities".  These
are defined and methods of computing one type of coordinate from a
spectral axis gridded in another are given.    A projection
representative of optical spectrometers is also defined. Coordinate
reference frames may be specified.</P>

<P> Paper IV is in preparation and is not yet ready for public 
comment.  It will define Distortion Correction Functions (DCFs) which
may be used to correct for instrumental "defects" including celestial
coordinate warps ("plate defects"), variation of actual frequency with
celestial coordinate, refaction, and the like.</P>

<EM> These documents will change in response to feedback  should we
receive any - many thanks to Steve Allen for numerous helpful remarks.
These papers were voted upon, at the ADASS meeting in Hawaii in
October 1999.  At that point they were - in principle - submitted to
the United States, European, and Japanese FITS Committees to be voted
upon.  They were not voted upon and then Tody, Valdes, and Davis of
NOAO made the suggestion to generalize and separate instrumental
correction into a Paper IV.  That has been done and the papers were
voted upon at the ADASS in Victoria in 2001.  We have now presented
the results we were told to present and the papers should be ready
fairly soon to go again to the committees for a vote.  Should that
ever happen, they will be submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (the
Supplements have been subsumed) for publication and will go before the
IAU FITS panel.  Please read and consider these documents carefully
and give us your considered comments.  The FITS standard controls how
we think about our data and you would not want to be stuck with a
standard that you do not like.</EM>

<P> This anonymous ftp area (ftp://ftp.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/wcs)
has been set aside for the early documents concerning the
representation of the coordinates of the pixels in FITS images. My two
early AIPS Memos (27 and 46) have been recovered and recast into
modern LaTeX (from TeX -1 or so).  In so doing, I redrew the figures
for both memos in PostScript, using AIPS to draw those for Memo 46 and
"hand" drawing those for Memo 27.  The files are called aips27.ps (of
modest size) and aips46.ps (about 600 kbyte in uncompressed form).
Therefore, it is stored only in the Unix compressed form aips46.ps.Z.
Try "zcat <file> | lpr -Pxxx" to avoid on-disk decompression; else
"lpr -s -Pxxx <file>" to avoid complaints about too-large files.</P>

<P>
Another early document is found in the files wcs88.tex and wcs88.ps.
This document is a draft by Hanisch and Wells concerning the meeting
held in Charlottesville in 1988 on "world coordinates".</P>

<P>
These earlier papers are intended to be superseded entirely by a new
document found (partly) in a file called wcs.tex.date.Z (the figures
are separate files not included in wcs.tex). <EM>[This document in now
superseded by the 3 documents described in the previous section.]</EM>
The real working document for a FITS paper authored by myself and Mark
Calabretta was called wcs.none.ps.Z (no figures, prints quickly), and
wcs.all.ps and wcs.all.ps.Z (all figures).  The figures are drawn with
PostScript programs which have all been verified with our printers and
ghostview. However, we have found several models of "postscript"
printer which simply fail on the documents and others which work, but
are exceedingly slow.  Hence, the quicker-to-print version.</P>

<P>
This was an evolving document, representing our opinion of the best
ways to represent coordinates.  To track earlier versions, I have left
the .tex copies of versions from June 1993, August 1993, September
1994, November 1994 and October 1995.  The June 1993 version was
widely advertised and presented at the AAS meeting in Berkeley.  The
August version was advertised and contained the results of some
discussions at Berkeley, primarily the reintroduction of the CDELTn
keywords.  The September 1994 version was discussed at the ADASS
meeting in Baltimore.  A document describing the changes from November
1994 to September 1996 is named wcs.9496.changes in the fits documents
area.</P>

<P>
Don Wells has asked me to include files representing my poster papers
at the June 1993 AAS meeting and September 1994 ADASS meetings.  I
have added these as Talk93.tex.Z, Talk93.ps.Z, Talk94.tex.Z,
Talk94.tex.Z, Poster93.ps, and Poster94.ps.  The 93 poster may have to
be broken into separate pages for some printers.  The page breaks are
obvious (a full line of % signs).</P>

<P>
Almost all of the files have been compressed using the standard Unix
compress command to save space and to speed network transmission.</P>

them to print, you may obtain paper copies of all 3 are by contacting
