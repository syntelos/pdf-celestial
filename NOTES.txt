  ...the vast amount of astronomical data requires an association
  between the pixel coordinate system and the world or physical
  coordinate system.  For example, an array of spectral flux
  measurements needs to be associated with wavelengths through some
  sort of dispersion solution, or an array of time-resolved flux
  measurements needs to be associated with actual times in UTC.  In
  the simplest cases, these associations can be expressed in linear
  terms: world coordinate = pixel coordinate · scale + offset where
  scale is the pixel size (in world coordinate units) and offset is a
  zero-point correction.  In more common cases, however, the relation
  between pixel coordinates and world coordinates is non-linear.

* Representations of world coordinates in FITS, Greisen, Calabretta, 2002 representations-fits/representations-I.pdf

  Wells et al. (1981) anticipated the need to specify the physical, or
  world, coordinates to be attached to each pixel of an N-dimensional
  image.  By world coordinates, we mean coordinates that serve to
  locate a measurement in some multidimensional parameter space.  They
  include, for example, a measurable quantity such as the frequency or
  wavelength associated with each point in a spectrum or, more
  abstractly, the longitude and latitude in a conventional spherical
  coordinate system which define a direction in space.  World
  coordinates may also include enumerations such as “Stokes
  parameters”, which do not form an image axis in the normal sense
  since interpolation along such axes is not meaningful.
