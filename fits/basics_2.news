  		FITS basics and information, Part 2

3 Software and Sample Data
 3.1 NOST 
	All NOST software is available from the NOST ftp site (4.1).

  3.1.1 FITS Product Conformance Tester with Instructions
	The FITS Product Conformance Tester is a software package in C
being developed by the NOST for validating FITS files.  The available
prototype validates required keywords in the primary header and, at
the user's option, prints selected values from the primary data array. 
Even after finding an error in a required keyword, it will continue
evaluating the file, looking for errors in required keywords.  If the
syntax errors do not keep the software from making a reasonable guess
as to the values of all the required keywords, and the resultant
values are valid, it will try to read the primary data array if the user
has so specified.                   
	Because this software is still under development, it should not
be run before reading the separate instructions file. 

  3.1.2 Header Lister 
	This program prints out all the headers in a FITS file, 
including the primary header and all extension headers.  It does not 
evaluate them for errors.  It is a useful tool for obtaining a quick 
summary of the contents of a FITS file.

  3.1.3 Error Test Files
	These files consist of several versions of the same FITS file,
a valid one and several with different kinds of header errors. They 
are useful for testing the ability of software designed to read FITS
files to cope with files that are not standard FITS or with errors in
the file.  The file includes only a primary header and data array.  Be
sure to use binary transfer for ftp access of FITS test files. 

 3.2 HEASARC
	The NASA/Goddard High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive
Research Center (HEASARC) has developed and maintains FITS software
and utilities, including the FITSIO package and FTOOLS utilities.  
See 4.2 for information on electronic access to FITSIO and supporting
documentation. 
	
  3.2.1 FITSIO 
	The FITSIO package, maintained by Bill Pence, provides
FORTRAN software for easily reading and writing FITS format files.
The current version is 3.7.  There is a C interface, consisting of a
set of C macro definitions, one for each FITSIO subroutine,
replacing the C wrapper routines of previous versions.   FITSIO runs
on most types of machines.  It supports all the currently defined
standard FITS extensions including IMAGE and BINTABLE and contains
world coordinates subroutines for conversion between pixel and
celestial coordinates.  There is also software support for the
checksum proposal discussed in section 2.7.             

  3.2.2 FTOOLS
	James Kent Blackburn and Bill Pence document the FTOOLS
collection of over 100 utility programs to create, examine, or modify
FITS data files.  These programs are useful for examining the contents
of FITS files and modifying them for input to more involved analysis
tasks; they cannot generally be used for detailed data analysis or model
fitting. The current version 3.2 was released in November 1994; new
versions are released about every 3 months. Users have the option of
installing the entire FTOOLS package, which includes many routines
specific to high energy astrophysics, or a core set that contains
only the routines that perform general operations on FITS files. 
FTOOLS can be built as a package within IRAF or as a set of stand
alone executable tasks.  FTOOLS is supported on the following
platforms: 

Unix: ALPHA/OSF, DEC/ULTRIX, SUN/SunOS, SUN/Solaris, MODCOMP/REALIX
VMS:  ALPHA/VMS, VAX/VMS.

Questions or comments should be sent to ftoolshelp@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov

  3.2.3 VERIFITS
	W. Pence (GSFC/HEASARC) has announced the VERIFITS program to
verify the conformance of any FITS format data file on magnetic disk to
the standard, checking keywords and data.  At user option it will list
the total number of pixels, number of null pixels and maximum and
minimum data values.  If it finds an error while evaluating the header,
it normally ceases validation and reports the error. The VERIFITS
program is a stand alone version of the fverify task that is included in
the IRAF or Host FTOOLS package. Both VERIFITS and fverify perform the
same verification checks, but fverify has a nicer user interface, as
provided by the IRAF or Host environments. Several different binary
executable versions of VERIFITS are available, for running on SUN
workstations, DECstations, DEC Alphas running OSF/1 or VAX/VMS
machines.The VERIFITS source code is also provided and may be easily
linked with the FITSIO library to run on the other types of machine
on which FITSIO is supported.  While VERIFITS has been extensively
tested, under some unusual circumstances not covered by the tests it
may still fail to detect a FITS format error or may issue an error
message that does not accurately describe the problem.                     

 3.3 ADC FITS Tables Browser 
	The Astrophysics Data Center has released the ADC FITS Table
Browser, which has been tailored specifically for use with the ADC 
CD-ROMs but may be used with other FITS ASCII Tables. It reads
standard FITS ASCII tables and allows the user to interactively browse
through them and selectively display any field or record in a table. 
File extraction facilities allow the writing of all or part of the input
table to disk in FITS or text file format. 
	Copies of the program for MS-DOS and Unix are available by
anonymous FTP on nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov in the 
directory /pub/ADC/software/ftb. See the file README.FTB for instructions
on downloading, installation, and use. 

 3.4 Converting FITS Files to Image Format
	Disclaimer: The mention of particular software packages is not
necessarily intended as an endorsement of those packages to the 
exclusion of others.  Users should obtain proper licensing for any
proprietary package or format mentioned. Information about publicly
available  nonproprietary packages is welcome, and, if the package
appears  relevant and useful, will be added to this posting. 
Information about  such packages should include how they can be
obtained and whom to  contact with questions.  It should also
describe any limits on the  FITS files that the package can handle
(e. g., NAXIS must be 2; data  array members must be integers).         

  3.4.1 Major Astronomical Imaging Packages
	The three major astronomical imaging packages -- the
Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS), the European Southern
Observatory Munich Image and Data Analysis System (ESO-MIDAS), and
the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) -- provide
facilities for displaying images stored in FITS files.  These
packages are large and probably best installed on major systems. 
AIPS was developed by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO), and IRAF by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories;
the origins provide an indication of the best applications.
Europeans might find ESO-MIDAS more convenient.

  3.4.2 pbm+
	The Extended Portable Bitmap Toolkit (pbm+) can be used for
converting many FITS files to image format. However, support is not
guaranteed for all FITS files where the data are in the form of an
image.  In particular, there may be problems when the data array
members are in IEEE floating point format (BITPIX<0) or the array has
more than two dimensions (NAXIS>2). 

  3.4.3 IMDISP (IBM/PC)
     Archie Warnock and Ron Baalke have announced release of version
7.9 of the IMDISP program. IMDISP is an interactive image processing
program that runs on an IBM PC computer and supports FITS input. 
IMDISP 7.9 is available via anonymous ftp at explorer.arc.nasa.gov
[128.102.32.10] in a file called imdisp79.zip in the pub/SPACE/SOFTWARE
subdirectory. and at nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov in the pub/ADC/software/imdisp
subdirectory.  It may also be available (at least for the time being)
through Simtel-20 [192.88.110.20] 

 3.4.4 Applications with xv 3.0
	For a system that has xv 3.0, some unsupported modifications
to apply it to FITS files exist.  Adam Bernstein
(adam@dragon.jpl.nasa.gov) has made some additional modifications to
the original set, to overcome some implementation problems.  They are
available by ftp to csi.jpl.nasa.gov in the /pub/users/adam directory.
They can handle files with any of the valid FITS values of BITPIX, and
can handle NAXIS>2 provided NAXISn=1 for n>2 (a convention often used
in radio astronomy). The file "convert.tar.Z" contains these changes,
as well as a new program called "FITS2GIF" created to allow
non-interactive conversion of a large number of FITS files to GIF
format.  Use of xv 3.0 at a site must be licensed. 

  3.4.5 ViewFITS (OS/2)	
	Dominique Beauchamp, Universite Laval, Quebec City, has
released version 0.4, rel. 1 of ViewFITS, a FITS reader for OS/2 2.1
presentation manager.  It is on ftp.cdrom.com in /pub/os2/incoming,
file name vf04r1.zip, although it will probably be moved to
/pub/os2/2_1/graphics/vf04r1.zip. This program gives the user the
opportunity to display FITS images (8,16 or 32 bits, integer or
float), modifying the gray shade palette, doing negation and zooming
out. 

  3.4.6 FITS and the Macintosh
	Thorsten Lemke, at Brunswick in Germany has added FITS support
to GraphicConverter for the Macintosh and provided the following
information.  GraphicConverter 1.7.7 or later can import FITS array
files with all five permitted data types (8, 16, 32 bit integer and
32, 64 bit real). Every FITS file will be converted to 8 bit gray scale
on opening because this is the maximum number of grays on a Macintosh.
GraphicConverter can convert FITS and other files to a lot of
different graphic file formats i.e. PICT, TIFF, GIF, PCX, IFF, PPM... 
GraphicConverter is available via ftp info-mac archives. 
A mirror site is
amug.org                 165.247.10.2     pub/ftp1/info-mac              1/1
ALL                                       ftp email
Arizona Macintosh Users Group, Phoenix, Arizona, USA

GraphicConverter is in the folder grf/util/graphicconverter*

	The site at NRAO, described in 4.3,contains a collection of
Usenet postings and electronic mail messages about the use of FITS
on Macintosh hardware, in fits/os-support/mac-os/. 

  3.4.7 FITSview (Windows)
	Bill Cotton at NRAO has announced an updated beta release,
version 0.4.0, of FITSview, a FITS image viewer for Windows. 
Celestial positions are determined using world coordinate
projections. All defined FITS data types are supported, as are
blanked pixels.  Two and three dimensional simple FITS images are
supported. FITSview runs on Windows 3.1 or later and uses any
multicolor (or multiple gray level) display. Extensive on-line
documentation is included. It is available by ftp from the NRAO
site:                              
 ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/os-support/ms-windows/fitsview/fitsv040.txt
 ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/os-support/ms-windows/fitsview/fitsview040.zip
Installation is described in fitsv040.txt.

 3.5 World Coordinates
	Two ANSI C functions, worldpos() and xypix(), convert 
(RA, dec) <--> pixel location for 8 common types of projective
geometries where "(RA,Dec)" are more generically (long,lat). These
functions are based on the World Coordinates implementation of Classic
AIPS. The software is in src/wcs/worldpos.tar.gz at the NRAO site
(section 4.3) and supporting documentation can be found in
documents/wcs/. 

4 On-line Information Sources
 4.1 NOST 	
	The NOST maintains a file of FITS information available by
anonymous ftp from nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits or by DECnet copy from
NSSDCA, in the directory FITS. A proposed reorganization could move
the FITS material to a FITS subdirectory under a STANDARDS
directory. NSSDCA is a VAX, and the files there cannot be accessed
using Mosaic. Lynx  will work with URL
ftp://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits.  A copy of the NOST files can be
reached using Mosaic from ftp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/fits. 
Because this site is not a mirror and must be manually revised,
updates may lag those at NSSDCA.           
	The FITS files include copies of the current NOST standard,
the Definition of FITS, in flat ASCII, PostScript, and LaTeX.  Style
and index files are provided for the LaTeX form.  The only difference
among the three formats is that the ASCII form lacks typeface
formatting; therefore, only one need be retrieved.  The draft
revisions to the standard covering the specification of units are
provided as a text file.  A current list of the extension type
(structure) names registered with the IAU FITS Working Group is
maintained. Also available, in LaTeX form, is a copy of the proposal
for the IMAGE extension, an earlier version of the paper cited in
2.1. The current version of the User's Guide is available in LaTeX,
Unix(.Z)-compressed PostScript and uncompressed PostScript, along
with a style file for the LaTeX version. A copy of the conventions
for physical blocking on various media, as adopted by the IAU FITS
Working Group, is available in flat ASCII text form.  The directory
also contains a modified version of this posting. An AAREADME.DOC
file describes the contents of the directory. 
	A SOFTWARE subdirectory contains the FITS Product Conformance
Tester prototype, along with instructions.  The instructions should be
retrieved along with the software. The C software to read and list the
headers of a FITS file is also in this subdirectory.  Another file
provides information on publicly available FITS software packages. The
ERRTEST subdirectory contains the error test files described in
section 3.1.1. Remember that binary transfer should always be used for
FITS files.  Both the SOFTWARE and ERRTEST subdirectories include
AAAREADME.DOC files describing their content. 

 4.2 HEASARC
	The HEASARC FITS software, utilities, and accompanying
documentation are available as follows:

ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/fitsio 
	contains the FITSIO package, and supporting documentation. 
ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/fitsio/verifits 
	contains the VERIFITS validator and supporting documentation. 
ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/ftools/release 
	contains the FTOOLS collection, and supporting documentation. 
The FTOOLS software is being distributed as compressed tar files. 

All three directories contain informational README files.

 4.3 NRAO
	A library of FITS material can be found at
ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits, located at NRAO.  This machine supports a
WAIS server named nrao-fits which has an index of all of the
FITS-related text files in the archive; the file nrao-fits.src is
have descriptive README files; in addition, the
available at think.com and at
ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/wais-sources/nrao-fits.src.  There is a
World Wide Web server for the FITS Archive as well, at the URL
http://fits.cv.nrao.edu.    
	The documents subdirectory of the fits directory contains a
number of subdirectories.  The BINTABLE draft for Astronomy and
Astrophysics is, in various formats, in files bintable_aa.*. A
proposals subdirectory is reserved for detailed proposals currently
being considered by the FITS committees. It contains the two
announcements of the checksum proposal, and a checksum subdirectory
contains the proposal itself and some supporting material. A drafts
subdirectory contains drafts of designs not yet submitted, for
example, a proposed method for incorporating data compression under
FITS.  The wcs subdirectory contains a draft of the current proposal
for world coordinate system conventions now under community review
and earlier documents and  presentations on world coordinates.                 
	Other subdirectories of the fits directory include sample FITS
files -- both actual data files and files specially constructed to
test the ability of software to read all kinds of FITS structures,
some code for particular environments, pointers to other code, and an
archive of Usenet postings related to FITS. 

4.4 HEAFITS Exploder
	An electronic mail listserver called HEAFITS has been set up
as a specialized group for discussion of High Energy Astrophysics-
specific FITS issues that would not necessarily be of interest to the
majority of subscribers to the existing sci.astro.fits newsgroup and
fitsbits mailing list. To *subscribe* to the HEAFITS group, send the
following one-line e-mail message to listserv@legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov: 
		subscribe heafits Your Name 
where 'Your Name' is your actual First and Last names. Messages to
the actual mailing list are sent to heafits@legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov.
